            <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), also known as the Web, is a system of interconnected documents that are accessible through the Internet. Tim Berners-Lee invented it at CERN in 1989. The WWW has become an essential part of modern life, and it is used for a variety of purposes, including communication, commerce, education, and entertainment.

            <h2>How does the Web work?</h2>
            <p>
            The Web is made up of a vast network of computers called web servers. These servers store web pages, which are documents that are written in HTML. HTML is a markup language that uses tags to define the structure and appearance of a web page.

            <p>
            When a user visits a web page, their computer sends a request to the web server that stores the page. The web server then sends the page to the user's computer, where it is displayed in a web browser.

            <h2>Differences between WWW and the Internet</h2>
            <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are often confused, but they are not the same thing. The WWW is a service that runs on top of the Internet. It allows users to access and interact with information that is stored on web servers. The Internet, on the other hand, is the underlying network that allows the WWW to function.
